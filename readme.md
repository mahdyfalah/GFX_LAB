# Lab0

## Programming
everything needed to run should already be included in the project including
3d models etc.

- to run the app: <br>
navigate to Lab0 dir in Terminal and run <br> 
```npm install -g lite-server``` <br>
then stat the app by running <br>
```lite-server``` <br>
you can access the application on <br>
```http://localhost:3000/```


- alternatively you can run the app by: <br>
```npx http-server``` <br>
but this lacks the auto-refresh functionality on code updates
