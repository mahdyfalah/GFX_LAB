# Lab0

## Programming

- to run the app: <br>
navigate to Lab0 dir in Terminal and run <br> 
```npm install -g lite-server``` <br>
then stat the app by running <br>
```lite-server``` <br>
you can access the application on <br>
```http://localhost:3000/```


- alternatively you can run the app by: <br>
```npx http-server``` <br>
but this lacks the auto-refresh functionality on code updates

## Administrative
- a chapter I found interesting: <br>
from chapter 1, page 2

```
1.1 APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS
The development of computer graphics has been driven both by the needs of the user
community and by advances in hardware and software. The applications of computer
graphics are many and varied; we can, however, divide them into four major areas:

1. Display of information
2. Design
3. Simulation and animation
4. User interfaces

Although many applications span two or more of these areas, the development of the
field was based largely on separate work in each.

## Tutorial
my favorite tutorials: <br>

- [GeeksForGeeks: How to Set Up a WebGL Project?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-set-up-a-webgl-project/) <br>
this is the exact tutorial I followed to do my Lab0, what I liked about it was
its simplicity, and what I would change about it, was the fact that the source code was
not in an interactive window, so by changing it you could directly see the results. 
this always helped me to understand the functionality of each part a lot quicker.<br>


- I also found other more complex examples interesting such as <br>
[WebglFundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) <br>
as they provided examples with the interactive environment exactly as I mentioned.
